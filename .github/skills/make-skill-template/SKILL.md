## How to use this skill

Attach this file to your Copilot Chat context, then invoke it when creating or
refining a skill under `.github/skills/`. Use it to scaffold new skills and to
check discoverability quality before committing.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "create a skill", "make a new skill", or "scaffold a skill"
- User wants to add a specialized capability to their GitHub Copilot setup
- User needs help structuring a skill with bundled resources
- User wants to duplicate this template as a starting point

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of what the skill should accomplish
- A clear, keyword-rich description of capabilities and triggers
- Knowledge of any bundled resources needed (scripts, references, assets, templates)

## Creating a New Skill

### Step 1: Create the Skill Directory

Create a new folder with a lowercase, hyphenated name:

```
.github/skills/<skill-name>/
└── SKILL.md          # Required
```

### Step 2: Generate SKILL.md with Frontmatter

Every skill requires YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>
description: '<What it does>. Use when <specific triggers, scenarios, keywords users might say>.'
---
```

#### Frontmatter Field Requirements

| Field | Required | Constraints |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | **Yes** | 1-64 chars, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, must match folder name |
| `description` | **Yes** | 10-1024 chars, must describe WHAT it does AND WHEN to use it |
| `license` | No | License name or reference to bundled LICENSE.txt |
| `compatibility` | No | 1-500 chars, environment requirements if needed |
| `metadata` | No | Key-value pairs for additional properties |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools (experimental) |

#### Description Best Practices

**CRITICAL**: The `description` is the PRIMARY mechanism for automatic skill discovery. Include:

1. **WHAT** the skill does (capabilities)
2. **WHEN** to use it (triggers, scenarios, file types)
3. **Keywords** users might mention in requests

**Good example:**

```yaml
description: 'Toolkit for testing local web applications using Playwright. Use when asked to verify frontend functionality, debug UI behavior, capture browser screenshots, or view browser console logs. Supports Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit.'
```

**Poor example:**

```yaml
description: 'Web testing helpers'
```

### Step 3: Write the Skill Body

After the frontmatter, add markdown instructions. Recommended sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `# Title` | Brief overview |
| `## When to Use This Skill` | Reinforces description triggers |
| `## Prerequisites` | Required tools, dependencies |
| `## Step-by-Step Workflows` | Numbered steps for tasks |
| `## Troubleshooting` | Common issues and solutions |
| `## References` | Links to bundled docs |

### Step 4: Add Optional Directories (If Needed)

| Folder | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `scripts/` | Executable code (Python, Bash, JS) | Automation that performs operations |
| `references/` | Documentation agent reads | API references, schemas, guides |
| `assets/` | Static files used AS-IS | Images, fonts, templates |
| `templates/` | Starter code agent modifies | Scaffolds to extend |

## Example: Complete Skill Structure

```
my-awesome-skill/
├── SKILL.md                    # Required instructions
├── LICENSE.txt                 # Optional license file
├── scripts/
│   └── helper.py               # Executable automation
├── references/
│   ├── api-reference.md        # Detailed docs
│   └── examples.md             # Usage examples
├── assets/
│   └── diagram.png             # Static resources
└── templates/
    └── starter.ts              # Code scaffold
```

## Quick Start: Duplicate This Template

1. Copy the `make-skill-template/` folder
2. Rename to your skill name (lowercase, hyphens)
3. Update `SKILL.md`:
   - Change `name:` to match folder name
   - Write a keyword-rich `description:`
   - Replace body content with your instructions
4. Add bundled resources as needed
5. Review with the [Reviewing Skills](../reviewing-skills/SKILL.md) skill

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Folder name is lowercase with hyphens
- [ ] `name` field matches folder name exactly
- [ ] `description` is 10-1024 characters
- [ ] `description` explains WHAT and WHEN
- [ ] `description` is wrapped in single quotes
- [ ] Body content is under 500 lines
- [ ] Bundled assets are under 5MB each

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Skill not discovered | Improve description with more keywords and triggers |
| Validation fails on name | Ensure lowercase, no consecutive hyphens, matches folder |
| Description too short | Add capabilities, triggers, and keywords |
| Assets not found | Use relative paths from skill root |
