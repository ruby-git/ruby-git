# Code of Conduct

ℹ️ We have adopted the [Ruby code of conduct](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/).

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and
collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the Ruby
community. It applies to all “collaborative space”, which is defined as community
communications channels (such as mailing lists, submitted patches, commit comments,
etc.).

- Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal
  attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always
  assume good intentions.
- Behavior which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

Report violations to the maintainers by [opening an
issue](https://github.com/ruby-git/ruby-git/issues/new) or contacting a
[maintainer](MAINTAINERS.md) privately.
