# Governance

This document explains how we steward the project with a light, principles-first
approach: enable trusted people, minimize dormant access, and keep decisions
transparent.

## Roles

A **Maintainer** is a trusted leader with write access who stewards the project's
health and direction. Responsibilities center on triage, review, merge, and
helping the community stay unblocked.

A **Project Lead** is a maintainer with additional administrative scope (repo
Admin, org Owner). They handle settings, secrets, access, and tie-breaks when
needed.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Maintainers invite contributors who consistently ship, review, and model our
values to become maintainers. Anyone can nominate themselves or others in an
issue or via a private note. Current maintainers discuss nominations (see
[Decision Making](#decision-making)) with a focus on contribution quality,
alignment with project goals, and communication style.

## Access Principles

- Stewardship: Maintainer access exists to keep the project healthy and responsive.
- Least privilege: Elevated access is temporary and kept only while it’s needed.
- Continuity: Dormant access is paused to protect the project and unblock
  contributors.
- Respect: Status changes are transparent, reversible, and acknowledge past
  contributions.

## How We Apply Them

- Staying active: Maintainers keep elevated access while participating (shipping,
  reviewing, triaging, or governance).
- When access is paused: If there’s no project activity for about a year, we’ll
  check in. If we don’t hear back after a short window, we move the maintainer to
  Emeritus and pause Owner/Admin/Write/package access (including CODEOWNERS
  entries).
- Coming back: Emeritus maintainers can be re-added quickly after a brief period of
  renewed participation to refresh context.
- Recognition: Emeritus maintainers remain listed to honor prior contributions.

Access changes are communicated openly (e.g., PRs or issues) and reflected in the
Maintainers list.

## Decision Making

Decisions are usually made by consensus among the active maintainers. If consensus
cannot be reached, the decision is made by a majority vote. If a vote results in a
tie, the Project Lead has the final say.

## Code of Conduct

All maintainers and contributors must adhere to the project's [Code of
Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
