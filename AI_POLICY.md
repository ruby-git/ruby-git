# AI Policy

AI assisted contributions are welcome in this project.

Reviewing and maintaining code requires human insight. While AI tools can be helpful
assistants, they are no substitute for human judgment and creativity.

We value the unique perspectives and critical thinking that our contributors bring.
If you use AI tools to assist your work:

1. **You are responsible**: You must review and understand every line of code or text
   you submit.
2. **Focus on quality**: Ensure that AI-generated content meets our standards for
   correctness, readability, and security, and respects all licensing requirements.
3. **Be transparent**: We encourage you to disclose if significant portions of your
   contribution were AI-generated.

Ultimately, the quality of this project depends on *your* expertise. Use tools
wisely, but lead with your own intelligence.
